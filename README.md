# healthCheck
Testing C# webapi

This API takes a set of measurements like heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. Each measurement has a set of ranges defined in the code that defines the individual score.
API determines the individual scores and calculates the final score which is the sum of all the scores.

**Run python test_health_check.py to verify all the different responses from C# rest API.**

This API has the swagger integration to test the logic.
