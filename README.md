Testing C# webapi

This API takes a set of measurements like heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. Each measurement has a set of ranges defined in the code that defines the individual score.
API determines the individual scores and calculates the final score which is the sum of all the scores.

This API has the swagger integration to test the logic.
